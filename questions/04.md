# Multiple Choice Question

We have two tables: `user` and `post`. A user has many posts, and a post belongs
to a user. How should we relate the two tables to one another?

## Incorrect

Create a join table that points to both the `user` table and the `post` table.

## Correct
Put a `user_id` foreign key on the `post` table pointing to the `id` primary key
in the `user` table.

> Correct! This is a one-to-many relationship. To relate the two tables to
> one another, we can add a foreign key attribute to the "many" side of the
> relationship. In that case, the "many" side is the `post` table.

## Incorrect

Put a `post_id` foreign key on the `user` table pointing to the `id` primary key
in the `post` table.

> Not quite. This would allow a user to only have one post.

## Incorrect

I don't know
