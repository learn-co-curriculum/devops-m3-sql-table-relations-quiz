# Multiple Choice Question

I want to establish a relationship between a `genre` table and a `book` table.
What kind of key would I need to add to the `book` table to establish this
relationship?

## Correct

Foreign Key

## Incorrect

Integer Key

> Not quite. It's likely that the key will be an integer, but that's not the
> correct name.

## Incorrect

Primary Key

> Not quite. A primary key is a value that uniquely identifies one row in a
> table; not relating two tables together.

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
