Consider the following diagram:

![football-ER-diagram](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/spring-mod-1/multiple-entities/football-team-and-football-player-schema.png)

Which of the following statements are true about the relationship above. Select
all that apply:

## Correct

This is a one-to-many relationship.

> Correct! A football player plays for one football team, while each team may
> have many football players.

## Incorrect

This is a many-to-many relationship.

> Not quite. This is a one-to-many relationship as a football player belongs to
> a football team; and a football team has many players.

## Correct

The `team_id` in the `football_player` table is a foreign key.

> Correct! The foreign key connects these two tables together. Since this is a
> one-to-many relationship, we add a foreign key attribute, `team_id` to the
> table on the "many" side of the relationship.

## Incorrect

The `team_id` in the `football_player` table is a primary key.

> Not quite. The `team_id` is a foreign key and connects the `football_player`
> table with the `football_team` table. The `id` field in the `football_player`
> table would be considered the primary key for that table.
